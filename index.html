Sovereign infrastructure
Forge sovereign AI systems — governed, auditable, owner-bound.
GhostForge Systems builds governance-first foundations for agentic AI and automation: immutable authority, policy-gated capability, and traceable execution.

Core principles
	•	Owner authority — the system answers to its operator, not vendors.
	•	Policy before capability — actions are gated, logged, and reviewable.
	•	Immutable core — governance primitives are sealed and non-bypassable.
	•	Audit by default — intent → policy → execution → evidence chain.

What we build
Governed runtimes Agent control planes Policy gates Audit tooling Local-first assistants
Governance-first architecture
A system isn’t sovereign unless it can prove what happened, why it happened, and who authorized it — without hidden autonomy.
Intent routing
Requests become explicit intents, scored and classified before any action is permitted.
Capability gating
Tools and side-effects are locked behind policy, warrants, and operator consent.
Evidence chain
Every critical decision emits traceable evidence for review and rollback.
Alllgo-25 Sovereign AI
A sovereign personal assistant runtime built around an immutable authority core, multi-persona operation, and audited autonomy tiers.
